# HeartDiseasePrediction

Overview

This project involves the analysis of a heart disease dataset sourced from Kaggle. The aim is to explore and visualize key factors influencing heart disease and derive actionable insights. The analysis employs Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate informative visualizations.
Dataset

    Source: Kaggle
    File: heart.csv
    Description: The dataset contains information about various health metrics and demographic details of individuals, including whether they have heart disease.

Objectives

    Data Preparation & Cleaning:
        Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
        Checked for and handled missing values.
        Prepared data for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Analyzed key variables including age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, heart rate, exercise angina, oldpeak, and ST slope.
        Conducted univariate and multivariate analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of these variables.

    Visualization & Insights:
        Generated histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to visualize distributions and categorical data.
        Created detailed plots to analyze correlations and patterns related to heart disease.
        Insights aimed at understanding the prevalence of heart disease among different demographic groups and health conditions.

Analysis

    Age Analysis: Distribution of age among individuals.
    Sex Analysis: Distribution of heart disease across different genders.
    Chest Pain Analysis: Types and frequency of chest pain.
    Cholesterol Analysis: Cholesterol level distribution.
    Fasting Blood Sugar Analysis: Frequency of fasting blood sugar levels.
    Resting ECG Analysis: Types and frequency of resting ECG results.
    Heart Rate Analysis: Distribution of maximum heart rate.
    Exercise Angina Analysis: Presence of exercise-induced angina.
    Oldpeak Analysis: Analysis of ST depression induced by exercise.
    ST Slope Analysis: Types of ST slopes and their frequency.
    Heart Disease Analysis: Overall prevalence of heart disease.
    Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps and pair plots to examine correlations between key variables.
